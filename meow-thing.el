  "Register a THING with INNER and BOUNDS.

Argument THING should be symbol, which specified in `meow-char-thing-table'.
Argument INNER and BOUNDS, can be one of the following
- a function receives no argument, return a cons of beginning and end point.
- a symbol represent a built-in thing
- (syntax . \"<syntax expression>\")
- (regexp \"<backward regexp>\" \"<forward regexp>\"),
  for detail see example 3

Examples:
1. Register URL
\(meow-thing-register 'url 'url 'url)

2. Register extend by non-whitespaces
\(meow-thing-register 'non-whitespace '(syntax . \"^-\") '(syntax . \"^-\"))

You can find the description for syntax in current buffer
with command `describe-syntax'.

3. Register extend by do/end block
\(meow-thing-register 'do/end '(regexp \"do\" \"end\") '(regexp \"do\" \"end\"))

The depth variable will be used during the search.  when the previous
regexp is found, depth will be incremented, when another is found,
depth will be decremented.  So the matched do/end can be found
together.

For the INNER case, the point of near end will be used.  For the BOUNDS case,
the point of far end will be used.
