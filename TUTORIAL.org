* Keybindings Cheat Sheet

We have created some recommended configs for specific keyboard layouts that you can re-use for a quick setup.

You can very easily change any of these when you setup Meow.

* Tutor inside Emacs

There is a tutor inside Emacs after installing Meow. Open it with ~M-x meow-tutor~.

* States

Meow's modal editing has 5 states: NORMAL, INSERT, MOTION, KEYPAD and BEACON.
In this tutorial, we will walk through these states and basic operations.

** INSERT

You can switch to INSERT state with ~meow-insert/append/change/open-below/open-above~.

There's nothing special in INSERT state, except ~ESC~ is bound to ~meow-insert-exit~. Use it to go back to NORMAL state.

NOTE:

If you enter INSERT state by ~meow-change~, the inserted content will be selected when you exit.

** NORMAL

NORMAL state is the default state for text editing.

For commands in NORMAL state is defined via ~meow-normal-define-key~.

[[file:COMMANDS.org][Check here for command documents]]

** MOTION

MOTION state is the default state for special modes, like ~dired~, ~proced~, etc.

By default, MOTION state has no keybindings, except ~SPC~ is used as the leader key. The original command on ~SPC~ can be access via ~SPC SPC~.

Users may want a consistent keybindings for movement globally, for example: k/j to move up/down. Usually, you can bind k/j in MOTION state,
however the original command on k/j is not accessible. To solve the problem, Meow introduce a simple solution.

For any keybinding you defined with ~meow-motion-overwrite-define-key~, the overwrited command will be bound to the key with ~hyper~ modifier.

Here's an example: you want use ~j~ as ~next-line~ globally.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (meow-motion-overwrite-define-key '("j" . next-line))
  (meow-leader-define-key '("j" . "H-j"))
#+end_src

Now ~j~ will act as ~next-line~, the original command on ~j~ (e.g. ~dired-goto-file~ in ~dired~) will be bound to ~H-j~.
Since we use ~j~ in the leader for ~H-j~, now we can call it via ~SPC j~.

It is also possible to route the original command(e.g. ~j~) to original motion key(e.g. ~n~).

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (meow-motion-overwrite-define-key '("j" . next-line))
  (meow-motion-overwrite-define-key '("n" . "H-j"))
#+end_src

Now you have swapped ~j~ and ~n~.

The settings we made has nothing to do with the name of a command. Thus, it works in all special modes.

** KEYPAD

KEYPAD is the state used for executing commands without modifier keys.

Entering KEYPAD state by pressing ~SPC~ in NORMAL or MOTION state.

Once KEYPAD state is enabled, your single key input will be translated according to following rules.

- ~x~ / ~h~ / ~c~ will be translated to ~C-x~ / ~C-h~ / ~C-c~ respectively.
- ~m~ will be translated to ~M-~, means next input will be modified by Meta.
- ~g~ will be translated to ~C-M-~, means next input will be modified by Control and Meta.
- Non-first ~SPC~ will be translated to literal prefix, means next input will not be modified.
- Rest letters as the first input will be translated to ~C-c <letter>~, ~mode-specific-map~ (keymap for ~C-c~) is used as the "leader" keymap.
- Rest letters as non-first input will be translated to ~C-<letter>~ .
- If the input results in no corresponding command, the input will fallback to an unmodified version. (e.g. If ~C-c a C-a~ is undefined, fallback to ~C-c a a~)

Some examples(assuming in NORMAL state).

| Input       | Translation | Explanation                |
|-------------+-------------+----------------------------|
| ~SPC a~       | ~C-c a~       | translated as ~C-<letter>~   |
| ~SPC a a~     | ~C-c a a~     | If there's no ~C-c a C-a~    |
| ~SPC c t t~   | ~C-c C-t C-t~ |                            |
| ~SPC x m t~   | ~C-x M-t~     | ~m~ as meta prefix           |
| ~SPC g x~     | ~C-M-x~       | ~g~ as control + meta prefix |
| ~SPC x SPC p~ | ~C-x p~       | ~SPC~ as literal prefix      |

For example, ~SPC c t t~ will be treated as ~C-c C-t C-t~.

After command execution, no matter succeed or failed, KEYPAD state will be disabled, the previous state will be activated.

To revoke input, use ~BACKSPACE~, to cancel all input and exit KEYPAD, use ~ESC~ or ~C-g~.

A which-key like popup is builtin with KEYPAD state.

** BEACON

#+begin_quote
BEACON - Batch KMacro
#+end_quote

BEACON is the state used for applying kmacro to multiple places quickly.
It's kinda like multiple-cursors, but it works differently.

BEACON state will be enabled  automatically when cursor moves into the secondary selection.
BEACON state will be disabled automatically when cursor moves out or secondary selection is disabled.

Once BEACON state is enabled, you can create fake cursors/regions with movement commands.

- ~meow-left/right~ will create cursors in current column.
- ~meow-next/back-word/symbol~ will create cursors at words' beginning or end.
- ~meow-mark-word/symbol~ will create regions for every same words.
- ~meow-visit/search~ will create regions for every same regexp.
- ~meow-find/till~ will create cursors for every same characters.
- ~meow-line~ will create regions for every N lines. (N is the number of selected lines).
- ~meow-join~ will cerate cursors for each indentation beginning.

Once you have fake cursors/regions, you have two options:
- *quickly & simple* Switch to INSERT state and *start recording kmacro* with ~meow-insert/append/change~,
  finish recording and apply this kmacro to all cursors/regions when exit INSERT state.
- *generally* Start recording with ~F3~ (~kmacro-start-macro-or-insert-counter~ or ~kmacro-start-macro~),
  finish recording and apply this kmacro to all cursors/regions with ~F4~ (~kmacro-end-or-call-macro~ or ~kmacro-end-macro~).

NOTE:
- Your recorded kmacro can be used later.
- Your can use your recorded kmacro with ~F4~ directly.
- You can't use KEYPAD in BEACON state.
- Once you start recording kmacro with ~F3~, you will be in NORMAL state.
